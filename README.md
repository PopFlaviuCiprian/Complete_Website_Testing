# Complete_Website_Automation_Testing
- In this project I am testing almost all the pages of the website https://formy-project.herokuapp.com/
- I am testing, page title, buttons hoovering, click on every button on each page, verify if buttons are displayed or activated, are visible or hidden, check the text on every button, I interract with checkboxes and radio buttons, I click on them and verify if they are checked, visible or enabled and send inputs to fields.
- All 45 tests are written in PyCharm, are passed to a Test_Suite and finally I generate an html report with all the tests result visible at the end of the video bellow. 
- This project is an update of an older project where i tested 3 pages of this website.
- We have to install the following tools:
